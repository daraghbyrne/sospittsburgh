### Strategic Vision
 
SOSP is dedicated to organizing, energizing and engaging the community of orchestra lovers to help the PSO recover from the devastation caused by the recent 2-month strike. We seek to ensure that the orchestra returns to its proper position as one of the very best orchestras in the World that serves our community with superb performances and educational programs and is recognized for artistic excellence throughout the country and in the international musical world. Our near-term focus will be on the following key priorities: 

- Restoring the orchestra’s premiere artistic leadership
- Attracting the nation’s most talented musicians to complete the orchestra’s complement
- Driving needed changes in governance, transparency and institutional culture
- Helping the Orchestra engage our youth and other historically underrepresented audiences
- Encouraging the Orchestra to pursue innovative marketing efforts with a particular focus on social media
- Empowering orchestra devotees to be effective advocates  for the organization’s future
